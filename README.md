# PNGrammar

Trivial wrapper around [Automatic Generation of Syntax
Diagrams](http://www-cgi.uni-regensburg.de/~brf09510/syntax.html) that I'm
using for [Read Ruby](http://github.com/runpaint/read-ruby). Simply renders a
given EBNF file as a PNG image. If the `convert` program (from ImageMagick) is
in your path, it is used to resize the PNG; otherwise a large border will be
present. 

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
